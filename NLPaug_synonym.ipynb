            "@ Acosta @ charliekirk11 This is what @ Acosta had to deal with while he did his live shot for @ CNN and I ‚Äô m sure a sight more from video we all saw. He is being called the enemy of the multitude. Helium then decided to interact & amp; be kind. Try it sometime when you stop spreading the tangible. @ cprcpr5 @ Acosta @ charliekirk11 @ CNN World health organization is this person? CNN and Fox should interview her and others in the tv and rent them explain why their behavior is acceptable. It would give Americans insight into the psychological science of Trumpism (Not Republican or Populist ). Hopefully learn from talking.\n",
